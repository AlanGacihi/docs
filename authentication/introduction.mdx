<Note>
  To get the `client_id` and `client_secret`, you need to request for API access
  at [API Access
  Keys](https://stage-cloud.belio.co.ke/team-overview/api-access-keys)
</Note>

Use your `client_id` and `client_secret` to obtain a Bearer token for authentication.
Once you have your Bearer token, you can start making requests to our API endpoints.

## How to Authenticate

Authentication is simple - just include your Bearer token in the Authorization header when making API requests to our endpoints.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN>
```

## Advanced Security

On the [API Access Keys](https://stage-cloud.belio.co.ke/team-overview/api-access-keys) page, you can set up additional security measures:

- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict API access to specific IP addresses, adding an extra layer of security for your production environment.
- **Web Origins**: Define allowed web origins (domains) that can make API requests, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.

These security features help ensure that only trusted sources can access your API keys and make requests to the Belio REST API.
