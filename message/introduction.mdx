This API enables you to send messages to recipients efficiently while allowing
management and monitoring of message delivery through callbacks.

## Prerequisite

Before you begin, ensure you have a valid and active **Service ID**. You can obtain one
by visiting the [Services](https://stage-cloud.belio.co.ke/services) page. Use the
[Service](/service) endpoint to list and retrieve the ID of the specific service
you intend to use.

## Advanced Features

For enhanced functionality, you can include an optional `receiptRequest` in
the request body. This feature allows you to receive delivery receipts for the messages
you send, enabling you to track their status and confirm successful delivery. The
`receiptRequest` object includes the following fields:

- **correlator**: A unique string to correlate the delivery receipt with the original message.
- **callbackUrl**: A URL where the delivery receipt will be sent.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://stage-mobilize-api-service/v1/message/{serviceId} \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    ...
  "receiptRequest": {
    "correlator": "<string>",
    "callbackUrl": "<string>"
  }
}'
```

By leveraging these features, you can ensure reliable message delivery and gain valuable
insights into the status of your communications.
